### Hi
This is Hamed. You can find a part of my projects here. I have another account at GitLab.com which consists of a number of projects of mine. I have the same id name at GitLab.

One of my top projects is the [Compiler one](https://github.com/hamedwaezi01/compiler). It is incomplete but I managed tried to write it maintainable.

Furthermore, the Classic Ai project, which is the [N Puzzle problem](https://github.com/hamedwaezi01/ai), has several implementations of some heuristic functions and algorithms, good for obtaining an overview of the solution.

My [Computer Vision course](https://github.com/hamedwaezi01/vision-basic) had a series of problems. I implemented functions for Furier, filter convolution, wavelet and a couple of other algorithms.
